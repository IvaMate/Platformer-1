# Platformer-1
This is a 2d platformer game, made in Gamemaker studio 2. It has 30 day free version so this is as much as I can share. Anybody who has this studio can try to play the game and see the code.
In this game I made, 2 types of enemies : the first one you are able to kill it by jumping on him, the second one cannot be killed. Also, you need to get the key to get further in the game.
All sprites, background and doors are animated.
